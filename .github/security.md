## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you happen to find any security vulnerabilities in this project, please let me know! I've turned on GitHub's security advisory and alert suggestions, but it's always possible that I'll miss something.

To let me know there's a security vulnerability, please make a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/emmahsax/Introduction-to-LightTable/issues/new) and fill in the Security Report section to the best of your capabilities.

I'll respond on the Issue or take appropriate action as soon as I'm able.

Thank you for helping my project to be as secure as possible.
